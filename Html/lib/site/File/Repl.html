<P>
The File:Repl module provides a simple file replication utility. This
allows two directory structures to be maintained.

<P>
The Update routine has several arguments. The first argument is a regular
expression, used to match all file names that to be maintained. The second
argument defines the action to be performed.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_a">a&gt;b</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Files in the 'a' directory are to be replicated to the 'b' directory if a
replica exists in 'b' directory and the timestamp is older than that of the
file in the 'a' directory.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_a">a&lt;b</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Files in the 'b' directory are to be replicated to the 'a' directory if a
replica exists in 'a' directory and the timestamp is older than that of the
file in the 'b' directory.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_a">a&lt;&gt;b</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Files in the 'a' directory are to be replicated to the 'b' directory if a
replica exists in 'b' directory and the timestamp is older than that of the
file in the 'a' directory. Files in the 'b' directory are to be replicated
to the 'a' directory if a replica exists in 'a' directory and the timestamp
is older than that of the file in the 'b' directory.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_A">A&gt;B</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Files in the 'a' directory are to be replicated to the 'b' directory - even
if no replica exists in 'b' directory. If a replica already exists in the
'b' directory with a timestamp that is newer than that of the file in the
'a' directory it is not modified.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_A">A&gt;B!</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Files in the 'a' directory are to be replicated to the 'b' directory - even
if no replica exists in 'b' directory. If a replica already exists in the
'b' directory with a timestamp that is newer than that of the file in the
'a' directory it is not modified. Orphan files in the 'b' directory are
deleted.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_A">A&lt;B</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Files in the 'b' directory are to be replicated to the 'a' directory - even
if no replica exists in 'a' directory. If a replica already exists in the
'a' directory with a timestamp that is newer than that of the file in the
'b' directory it is not modified.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_A">A&lt;B!</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Files in the 'b' directory are to be replicated to the 'a' directory - even
if no replica exists in 'a' directory. If a replica already exists in the
'a' directory with a timestamp that is newer than that of the file in the
'b' directory it is not modified. Orphan files in the 'a' directory are
deleted. 

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_B">B</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Files in the 'a' directory are to be replicated to the 'b' directory - even
if no replica exists in 'b' directory. If a replica already exists in the
'b' directory with a timestamp that is newer than that of the file in the
'a' directory it is not modified. Files in the 'b' directory are to be
replicated to the 'a' directory - even if no replica exists in 'a'
directory. If a replica already exists in the 'a' directory with a
timestamp that is newer than that of the file in the 'b' directory it is
not modified.

</DL>
<P>
The verbose flag has several valid values:

<OL>
<LI>
<P>
No verbosity (default mode)

<LI>
<P>
All file copies and deletes are printed.  

<LI>
<P>
Files identified in each directory that match the regex are printed.
SetDefault parameters are also displayed, and the regex and commit
parameters printed each time the Update routine is called.

<LI>
<P>
Files with identical names in both directories are printed.  

</OL>
